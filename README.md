- Task 1
> Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. 
> We will consider **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, and **u**  as vowels for this VowelCountTask.
> The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
> *Do not use LINQ-queries to solve problem!*

- Task 2
> Implement the algorithm for finding the GCD of two integers.
> The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.
